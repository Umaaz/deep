# distributor

This module is responsible for accepting incoming client requests. This includes:

- **Snapshots**: Requests to ingest new snapshots from clients
- **Polls**: Requests for client tracepoint configs

## Overview

This module is deployed using the target 'distributor'. Once started it will create receivers based on the config,
which will accept client requests. These requests are then processed into a common format [deep-proto](), and processed
by a common logic.

### Snapshots

When the distributor receives a snapshot, it will forward the data to an [ingester](../ingester) instance. This will be
done by using a Ring client to select the correct ingester.

### Polls

When the distributor receives a poll, it will forward the request to a [tracepoint](../tracepoint) instance. These
instances will then load the config for the Org Id and client and send the response back to the client.


## Metrics
There are several metrics generated by the distributor that track requests and performance.

See [distributor dashboards](../../dashboards/distributor)
