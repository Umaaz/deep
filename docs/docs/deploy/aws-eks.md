# AWS EKS

To deploy DEEP as a Pod in EKS there is a provided example of
a [deployment](../../../examples/kubernetes/aws-eks-deployment) file that contains the service, deployment and config.

## Configure

Before you can use any of the examples that use AWS S3 you will need to create an IAM role to allow DEEP access to the
bucket. See [AWS/Permissions](./aws/permissions.md) for more info.
