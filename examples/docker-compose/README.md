# Docker Compose Examples
In this folder we have a few examples of using DEEP with docker compose.


## Examples

 - [local](./local/README.md) - a simple example deploying to use docker locally
 - [debug](./debug/README.md) - the same as local but uses the debug build for deep
 - [distributed](./distributed/README.md) - deploys deep as a collection of containers 
 - [s3](./s3/README.md) - deploys as a single binary but connects to s3 for storage (uses minio to simulate AWS S3)
