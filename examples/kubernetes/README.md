# Kubernetes Examples

Here we have a couple of examples of deploying deep into kubernetes. These are here mainly as reference and not as a way
to deploy for production use.

## Helm Charts
There is a separate project available that lets you deploy [Deep as a Helm Chart](https://github.com/intergral/deep-helm).

## Examples

 - [aws-eks-deployment](./aws-eks-deployment/README.md)
 - [aws-eks-distributed](./aws-eks-distributed/README.md)
